+-----ALT LYRICS I FORGOT THAT I WROTE A WHILE AGO-----+

I don't want your microwaved gravy
I don't want a meal with no fun
It's the future everythings different
Everythings made from 0s and 1s

Electronic technical process
Circuit boards and chips on my mind
I want food that fills up my fuel cells
I want something one of a kind

I want digital TV dinner
Holographic soup for the soul
And I want digital TV dinner
I want something new in my bowl

There's capacitors in my oatmeal
Bits and Bytes cool off in my drink
PCBs are stealing my bread crumbs
Floppy disks are clogging my sink

Put computers back in the office
Get these wires out of my floor
I don't want to talk to your robot
I can't take this world anymore

No more digital TV dinner
I was promised quite a bit more
So no more digital TV dinner
This is not the world that i asked for
No more digital TV dinner
You're not real you're just a machine
So no more digital TV dinner
Look away from the monitor screens

I want digital TV dinner
Holographic soup for the soul
And I want digital TV dinner
I want something new in my bowl

No more digital TV dinner
You're not real you're just a machine
So no more digital TV dinner
Look away from the monitor screen
