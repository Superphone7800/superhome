          <font face="Helvetica" size="5">Spotify Sucks</font></b></u></p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -3"><i>
          <font face="Helvetica" size="4">December 3rd, 2025</font></i></p>
          <p><font size="4">Today is Spotify Wrapped day, every year, all across 
          the internet, people post what the app says they've been listening to 
          the most. Top artists, top genres, some artists even include little 
          recorded videos thanking their most loyal listeners, how quaint!</font></p>
          <p><font size="4">I despise Spotify Wrapped day and Spotify as a 
          whole.</font></p>
          <p><font size="4">Spofity as a concept is the logical continuation of 
          the music industry's never-ending quest to compensate artists as 
          little as possible while making as much money off of them as they can. 
          This is reflected starkly in the criminally low payouts to any and all 
          artists on the platform. The average seems to be around <i>0.2-0.4 
          cents</i> a stream. Not 4 cents, not 2 cents, 2 to 4 <i>tenths of a 
          cent</i> for every listen. This is by no means an issue that's gone 
          unaddressed, Gary Numan, one of the pioneers of electronic music as we 
          know it today, has gone on record and stated that for a track that hit 
          one million streams on Spotify he was paid </font>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;"><font size="4">£37. </font></span>
          <font size="4">The truth of the matter is that the average person 
          doesn't know any of this, and the convenience of having an app with 
          all the music on it is too great for your average Joe to really 
          consider getting rid of it. Why, if you buy premium you get to listen 
          ad free! At least the money is going to a good place, right?</font></p>
          <p><font size="4">In June of 2025 Spotify CEO David Elk's investment 
          firm pledged 600 Million dollars to Helsing, a German munitions 
          company who specializes in drone development and AI assisted 
          surveillance technology. Now the money that's being siphoned out of 
          the pockets of musicians across the globe is being used to blow up 
          children! One of the most obnoxious parts about having music on 
          Spotify is that you can't just upload it yourself, you have to either 
          have it done through your label, or for smaller artists like myself 
          who publish independently, you have to use a go-between service like 
          DistroKid or Routenote. This introduces a whole new layer of awful to 
          the experience; want to upload a song with samples? You'd better hope 
          any and all of them are either cleared with the rights holder or 
          public domain. Can't find the rights holder for an obscure recording 
          from a UK based college TV station in the 70s? Tough luck kid, it's 
          not going up until you remove or replace it. Prominent upload services 
          like Distrokid also don't allow you to upload &quot;Spoken Word&quot; to Spotify, 
          what does &quot;Spoken Word&quot; entail? Who knows, it's ultimately up to their 
          discretion, and that means that the opening and closing bookends to my 
          last album 7800 aren't viable. </font></p>
          <p><font size="4">This all leads us to one question, Why? Why keep my 
          music on Spotify? Truthfully, I find it harder and harder to justify 
          it to myself every day. But the biggest issue I run into is that most 
          people my age use almost exclusively Spotify. All the big artists are 
          on there, why switch to Bandcamp when there's no Chappel Roan there? 
          Why buy a CD of Taylor Swift's new album that requires you to put it 
          in some flavor of player when you can listen to the whole thing for 
          free on your phone whenever you want? People value convenience, and 
          they don't like being told that their convenience is objectively 
          harmful. Some sizeable acts have started taking their work off of 
          Spotify (King Gizzard, Xiu Xiu, Massive Attack, Godspeed You Black 
          Emperor, etc) but this has also coincided with sharp downturns in 
          listeners, people just aren't willing to jump ship for a couple of 
          artists, and when you're trying to make a living off your music, 
          you're going to feel it in your wallet cutting off nearly half your 
          listener base.

          the end of the day, if you want to listen to objectively worse mixes 
          of my music with incomplete tracklists while Shaq tries to sell you

          all while giving me no support whatsoever it's your funeral.</font></span></p>

          account, look at your wrapped this year, look at your top artist, and 
          if possible go over to Bandcamp and buy at least one of their albums. 
          $7 for one album is roughly equivalent to 350,000 streams. Which one's 
          more sustainable? You do the math.</span></font></span></td>

          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -1"><font size="4">Hello 
          there! I'm Bea Thurman, all-the-time music person, graphic designer, 
          and webmaster here at Superphone, and this is the new blog! This is 
          the place to go for my ramblings, musings, and stories about things 
          and stuff! For this inaugural entry, I figured I'd tell you the story 
          of one of my most meaningful tracks, Beautiful (Are You?) From 7800.</font></p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -1"><font size="4">It was the 
          summer of 2024, in the heat of the US Presidential election. The 
          burgeoning fascists at the Republican party were putting all of their 
          marbles behind one Donald Trump, and his bumbling moron of a vice 
          presidential pick JD Vance. Vance was and is no stranger to just 
          making things up to hurt people he doesn't like, so he decided to 
          start a little rumor about the Haitian immigrants in the town of 
          Springfield, Ohio. He said that they were kidnapping people's pets and 
          eating them, and that they were turning this poor little town into 
          something out of Escape from New York. It doesn't take a brain genius 
          to tell that neither of these things are true, but Republicans aren't 
          exactly known for being smart, and they immediately latched onto it.</font></p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -1"><font size="4">Trump 
          echoed his sentiment at the debate a few days later, &quot;They're eating 
          the dogs, they're eating the cats&quot; he said with no hint of shame on 
          national TV to an audience of millions. Shortly after, the worst 
          people in the country began to close on the town of Springfield like 
          moths to a flame. The Klan handed out flyers and put up recruitment 
          posters around downtown, people drove around in their beater pickup 
          trucks with shotguns hanging out the windows to assert dominance, and 
          schools and hospitals closed due to a wave of bomb threats. Living in 
          Columbus, Springfield is less than an hour drive east of me. So, as a 
          show of basic human decency I headed over there to eat at a local 
          Haitian Creole restaurant. The food was excellent, the prices were 
          reasonable, and the portions were massive, but what I noticed the most 
          during my trip was the people. Everybody there was having a good time. 
          People were getting lunch, catching up with old friends, stopping in 
          on their way through town, and it made me realize. Life doesn't have 
          to suck. The people that make life suck are in reality a far smaller 
          percent of humanity than they'd like to have you believe. The things 
          that divide us are as arbitrary as the borders that define us, and the 
          sooner we all realize that, the happier we'll all be. After the drive 
          home I wrote up the lyrics and lead synth line to what would become 
          Beautiful (Are You?). By making a song about the world being cool 
          without a hint of irony, it became a conscious subversion of songs 
          like Beautiful World by DEVO (Still love those guys though). In a 
          world permeated constantly by fear, hate, and negativity, being nice 
          without an ulterior motive can sometimes be the most effective form of 
          subversion.</font></p>
