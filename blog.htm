          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -1"><font size="4">Hello 
          there! I'm Bea Thurman, all-the-time music person, graphic designer, 
          and webmaster here at Superphone, and this is the new blog! This is 
          the place to go for my ramblings, musings, and stories about things 
          and stuff! For this inaugural entry, I figured I'd tell you the story 
          of one of my most meaningful tracks, Beautiful (Are You?) From 7800.</font></p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -1"><font size="4">It was the 
          summer of 2024, in the heat of the US Presidential election. The 
          burgeoning fascists at the Republican party were putting all of their 
          marbles behind one Donald Trump, and his bumbling moron of a vice 
          presidential pick JD Vance. Vance was and is no stranger to just 
          making things up to hurt people he doesn't like, so he decided to 
          start a little rumor about the Haitian immigrants in the town of 
          Springfield, Ohio. He said that they were kidnapping people's pets and 
          eating them, and that they were turning this poor little town into 
          something out of Escape from New York. It doesn't take a brain genius 
          to tell that neither of these things are true, but Republicans aren't 
          exactly known for being smart, and they immediately latched onto it.</font></p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -1"><font size="4">Trump 
          echoed his sentiment at the debate a few days later, &quot;They're eating 
          the dogs, they're eating the cats&quot; he said with no hint of shame on 
          national TV to an audience of millions. Shortly after, the worst 
          people in the country began to close on the town of Springfield like 
          moths to a flame. The Klan handed out flyers and put up recruitment 
          posters around downtown, people drove around in their beater pickup 
          trucks with shotguns hanging out the windows to assert dominance, and 
          schools and hospitals closed due to a wave of bomb threats. Living in 
          Columbus, Springfield is less than an hour drive east of me. So, as a 
          show of basic human decency I headed over there to eat at a local 
          Haitian Creole restaurant. The food was excellent, the prices were 
          reasonable, and the portions were massive, but what I noticed the most 
          during my trip was the people. Everybody there was having a good time. 
          People were getting lunch, catching up with old friends, stopping in 
          on their way through town, and it made me realize. Life doesn't have 
          to suck. The people that make life suck are in reality a far smaller 
          percent of humanity than they'd like to have you believe. The things 
          that divide us are as arbitrary as the borders that define us, and the 
          sooner we all realize that, the happier we'll all be. After the drive 
          home I wrote up the lyrics and lead synth line to what would become 
          Beautiful (Are You?). By making a song about the world being cool 
          without a hint of irony, it became a conscious subversion of songs 
          like Beautiful World by DEVO (Still love those guys though). In a 
          world permeated constantly by fear, hate, and negativity, being nice 
          without an ulterior motive can sometimes be the most effective form of 
          subversion.</font></p>
